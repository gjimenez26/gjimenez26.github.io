            <p>
                Everyone has been away from home with a dead phone or no way to charge their devices, especially on hot, sunny days spent outdoors. There’s a need for a simple, wearable solution that can generate power on the go without relying on bulky chargers or batteries.

                Blake Kieckhafer, Grant Gardener, Hunter Fraser, Trammell Evans, and the list goes on and on. These people have one thing in common, they all got lost and they all haven’t been found. The product that our company is going to produce promises to provide a solution to prevent these types of problems. We are going to build a hat that has a battery so that it can charge your phone. 
          In our day and age it is super important to keep your phone charged just to stay connected. This is visible in not just these “unlikely events’ but it happens in your everyday life. If you crash, how are you gonna call a family member to pick you up, you also need to call the cops. Our hat will solve countless problems for every person no matter if you live in a suburb,a city, or even in the middle of nowhere. This hat will not only be a functional charger but it will also look like a normal hat. The sleek simplistic design of the hat will prioritize comfort and fashion so you don’t have to lose anything you gain from wearing a hat, you only gain the added benefit of being able to charge your phone. 
          Our hat will have a small solar powered cell in either the brim of the hat or the top of the hat. Obviously this alone wouldn’t look very good so we plan to put a material on top to cover the solar cell so that it is not visible. Then there will be a battery in the hat so that all the power that the solar cell receives gets stored in the battery. Lastly we will have a retractable cable that extends in and retracts out so that you can charge your phone without having to remove your hat. Keep in mind that none of these parts will be visible to other people, so it will look like a normal hat.
